[CC] Good NFR. ISO-27001 and 27002 do not explicitly state what type of encryption should be used, so this could be added in along with considerations for encryption at rest as well as on the wire.
[DR] I like this NFR. We make the assumption that they have ISO /IEC 27001 compliant Policies & Procedures but it makes sense to set a bench mark and aim to achieve it.

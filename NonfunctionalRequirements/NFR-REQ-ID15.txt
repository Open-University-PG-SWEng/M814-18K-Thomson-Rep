[OH] Should it be that all the visited pages are in the selected language (not only the login window)?
[DJT] There is no mention of language selection, just that the login section should be in all languages. I agree that there should be a language selection using a flag and internationalised text options, which changes the page language
[JF] What OH is recomending, another requirement should take care of it. As the system, previous login, doesn't have any knowledge about the customer preferences, this non-functional requirement should be considered as a requirement by itself.
[RB] Completely agree with all the above comments, just having option of login page in different language will not help it should be followed throughout the website. Also not sure behind the logic of choosing just the European languages as the option, considering its commonwealth games the audience will perhaps benefit with other language option included besides the European ones. May be some research into the main languages spoken in the world and using them would improve the requirement.

REQ-ID: 13
Description: Accessing the booking must be a simple process for the user
Type: Usability
Rationale: A difficult process is likely to cause a great deal of user dissatisfaction.
Fit Criterion: Without any prior preparation, 75% of users should be able to navigate to the correct webpage, input any necessary information and be presented with their booking details within one minute of the initial contact with the booking system.

[OH] Is one minute not excessive in order to retrieve a booking? 
I assume the user will enter a booking number in a text field, is the one minute for the system to fetch the booking or for the entire process from login etc.?
If it is for the entire process, how is this going to be measured?
[DJT] Agree one minute seems long, in which case it must be for the whole process. Would suggest benchmarking the time via user testing, but since a time needs to be picked it may be arbitrary
[JF] I agree with DJT. It can be difficult to benchmark this fit criterion. I would suggest another type of measurements like a number of clicks or steps. If there is the possibility for user testing time would also be good.

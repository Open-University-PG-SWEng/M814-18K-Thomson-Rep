REQ-ID: NFR-09
Description: System shall be available 24 hours per day
Type: 12d
Rationale: In order to allow fair access to tickets, maintenance of the system should not cause down time. Scheduling down-time outside of standard office hours would affect international customers disproportionately.
Fit Criterion: It must be possible to deploy updates and perform routine maintenance to the system without the need to take the service offline.

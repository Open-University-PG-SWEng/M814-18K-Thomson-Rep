[CS] Good use of the WCAG guidelines. You might want to add a percentage of the number of users to the fit criterion though, it's probably not feasible for 100% of users to be able to select the price within the time specified.
[AF] Good use of the standard, however I think that the 3s is a bit short for partially sighted person. The Rationale is looks more like a Fit Criterion in you NFR. Also, If you refer to the WCAG standard, then the Fit Criterion's measurable criterion should be selected from the refered standard. I saw no such criterion in the standard (i.e. 3s), so it may need clarification.

- I undertand the phrase "within 3 seconds of coming it across for"
may be a typo, but it needs to be corrected so as to clearify the statement.
- Maybe The Fit Criterion should have been percentages rather than time, since you are referring to a group of users. i.e. "98% of partially sighted users will select a concessionary price without assistance".

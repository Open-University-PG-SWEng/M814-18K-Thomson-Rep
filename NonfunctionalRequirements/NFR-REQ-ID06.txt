Originator: Thomas Selby

Comments:
[DR] Should the rationale say quick or quicker? If quicker, quicker than what? 5 Seconds as a validation time sounds fair to me. Do we need to mention (hypothetically) what services would be delayed?
[AM] Why was 5 seconds selected as opposed to 4 seconds?  Where did this number come from?

Comments: Revised NFR
@[DR] Rationale rectified to quick and reference to service delays removed.
@[AM] less 5secs gives a range of performance i.e. between 1 and 4.
@[AM] below 5secs was identified during market research as adequate response time user can tolerate on average.

REQ-ID: NFR-09
Description: System shall be available 24 hours per day
Type: 12d
Rationale: In order to allow fair access to tickets, maintenance of the system should not cause down time. Scheduling down-time outside of standard office hours would affect international customers disproportionately.
Fit Criterion: The deployment of routine maintenance patches should not require more than 5 minutes of system down time per patch.

Comments: [RB] The fit criterion seems like a requirement itself as it does not clearly state as to how this will be achieved thus has no testing measures available. Perhaps adding that any changes will take effect in next login session and will not disrupt any current session of the user, will make it clear for the developers.

[CS] Additionally, 100% uptime is probably not possible, with data centres typically offering 99.9% or 99.99% uptime. Perhaps this could be a useful measure to include in the fit criterion.
[PC] Updating fit criterion to be more measurable
[LA] How many patches are there estimated to be per month/week? This would surely impact the overall availability?

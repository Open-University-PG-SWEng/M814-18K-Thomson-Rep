Comments: [RB] Very pertinent NFR conforming to the current standards and practices of data handling.
Comments: [SS] 	This NFR is very important so the references to specific standards is great.
		To me the second part of the rationale is a repeat of the description.
		An alternative rationale may be to go one level higher and consider the consequences of not being compliant.
		The fit criterion is well written as it removes the ambiguity of when the product must be compliant.

REQ-ID: NFR-05-01
Description: Tickets are written to the reallocation pool without delay.
Type: 12 (Performance)
Rationale: A delay in processing the return of tickets will have a negative impact on customer satisfaction. It may also cause the customer to think that the transaction was unsuccessful and abandon / restart the process.
Fit Criterion: 95% of ticket writes to the reallocation pool must complete within 2 seconds. The remaining 5% must complete within 10 seconds.

[AF] Good NFR. Not offering solution, or technical details, but include good set of criterions to measure the fitness requirements. 
Comments: [RB] Although the fit criterion quantifies time needed to deal with the 95% of the tickets thatï¿½s added to reallocation pool but does not mention any range for how the rest 5% is dealt thus making the performance measurement weak.

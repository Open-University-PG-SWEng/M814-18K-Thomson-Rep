Type: 12
Rationale: There will be a high level of demand, in the order of many tens of thousands per hour, and the system must operate without significant degradation.
Fit Criterion: The system shall average a retrieval time of under a tenth of a second when there are 30 requests per second.
Originator: Thomas Shelby
Comments:
[DJT] I wonder what would constitute failure? Is there a threshold over which failure is triggered or is it just anything over 1/10th of a second? Would suggest user satisfaction would tolerate higher
[DJT] 30 requests per second is 108,000 per hour. This seems high when interview with Thomas suggested 10,000's per hour.

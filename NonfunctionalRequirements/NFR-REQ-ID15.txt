[OH] Should it be that all the visited pages are in the selected language (not only the login window)?
[DJT] There is no mention of language selection, just that the login section should be in all languages. I agree that there should be a language selection using a flag and internationalised text options, which changes the page language
[JF] What OH is recomending, another requirement should take care of it. As the system, previous login, doesn't have any knowledge about the customer preferences, this non-functional requirement should be considered as a requirement by itself.

[TC] Given the fit criterion is it either does it or doesn't it sounds more like a functional requirement.
[DJT] Fit criterion is not boolean. Tickets returned correctly, however, is. Overall failure is > 0% of purchases incorrectly refunded.
[DJT] NFR changed as it is now a better fit for the requirement AM-001: Find the tickets and ensure validity
[DR] I have difficulty identifying what intuitive is / means. I find it difficult to quantify and my views will probably be different to somebody elses'.
[DJT] Good point. The description is about a quality of the system. The rationale and fit criterion explain how it is to be measured and hopefully remove ambiguity. The actual values may be subject to adjustment from user testing and benchmarking.

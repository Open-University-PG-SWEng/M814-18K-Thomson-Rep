REQ-ID: NFR-ID11
Description: The system shall always retrieve the ticket to be returned quickly.
Type: 12
Rationale: There will be a high level of demand, in the order of many tens of thousands per hour, and the system must operate without significant degradation.
Fit Criterion: The system shall average a retrieval time of under a tenth of a second when there are 100,000 requests per hour.
Originator: Thomas Shelby
Comments:
[DJT] I wonder what would constitute failure? Is there a threshold over which failure is triggered or is it just anything over 1/10th of a second? Would suggest user satisfaction would tolerate higher
[DJT] 30 requests per second is 108,000 per hour. This seems high when interview with Thomas suggested 10,000's per hour.
[CS] 108,000 per hour is high, but this would presumably be peak usage and may only last for a couple of minutes, when tickets for a high-profile event go on sale, for example. 30 requests per second is probably not unreasonable.
[PC] would it be more appropriate to state the maximum average retrieval time up to a certain level of requests per hour? This may be more useful to developers when designing auto scaling as it will guarantee performance at all levels (to an agreed level).
[AM] @PC I think that your comment makes the most sense to me as it allows the developers the most flexibility and clarity when they have the maximum from the original requirement, so I have changed it from requests per second to requests per hour.

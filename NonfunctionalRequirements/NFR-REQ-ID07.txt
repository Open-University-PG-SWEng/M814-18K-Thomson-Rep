REQ-ID: NFR-07
Description: Access to the system to initiate a ticket return shall comply with WCAG 2.1 accessibility guidelines
Type: Accessibility Standards
Rationale: To maximise accessibility so that a minimum of 95% of customers can return unrequired tickets.
Fit Criterion: 95% of users can initialise a ticket return within 2 minutes of accessing the system.

Comments: [SS]  My understanding is the type refers to the type from the MRP NFR categories.
		The rationale as it is currently written has elements of a fit criterion - in my opinion the first part could be the complete rationale.
		I would still consider the product a failure if 5% of people were not able to return unwanted tickets due to accessibility.
		A suggestion for amendment to the fit criterion may be that X% of users are able to return the ticket without assistance from someone else.
		The use of a time criterion is good and 2 minutes seems like a reasonable timeframe.

Comments: [SS]  My understanding is the type refers to the type from the MRP NFR categories.
		The rationale as it is currently written has elements of a fit criterion - in my opinion the first part could be the complete rationale.
		I would still consider the product a failure if 5% of people were not able to return unwanted tickets due to accessibility.
		A suggestion for amendment to the fit criterion may be that X% of users are able to return the ticket without assistance from someone else.
		The use of a time criterion is good and 2 minutes seems like a reasonable timeframe.
Comments: [SAB] 
Initiating a process in 2 minutes is too long a time frame, it might invalidate useability or performance. If it's just to intialise, i suggest max time of 5sec. 
i.e 98% of users will initialise a ticket return within 5sec.

The issue is, it's not clear what initialising is, is it just to start the process of ticket return? or the complete process of ticket return?.

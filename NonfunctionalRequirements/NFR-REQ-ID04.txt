REQ-ID: NFR-REQ-ID04
Description: The system must ensure the accuracy of all ticket return reasons captured.
Type: 12 (Performance)
Rationale: To ensure accuracy of data and to prevent fraudulent activity, the system should not allow a ticket to be returned if it is against the organisation's return policy.
Fit Criterion: 99% of all return reasons must be validated by the system, the remaining 1% should allow for manual validation performed by a user within 24 hours.

[CS] I would question what circumstances would not be able to be validated by the system. If there is a valid reason for a ticket to not be automatically validated, could you really specify a percentage that would fit this? I think that in this case, it might be reasonable to say that 100% of ticket returns must be validated by the system.

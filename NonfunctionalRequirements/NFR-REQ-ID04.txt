REQ-ID: NFR-REQ-ID04
Description: The system must ensure the accuracy of all ticket return reasons captured.
Type: 12 (Performance)
Rationale: To ensure accuracy of data and to prevent fraudulent activity, the system should not allow a ticket to be returned if it is against the organisation's return policy.
Fit Criterion: 99% of all return reasons must be validated by the system, the remaining 1% should allow for manual validation performed by a user within 24 hours.

[CS] I would question what circumstances would not be able to be validated by the system. If there is a valid reason for a ticket to not be automatically validated, could you really specify a percentage that would fit this? I think that in this case, it might be reasonable to say that 100% of ticket returns must be validated by the system.
[RB] I partly agree with CS i.e. 100% of the tickets should be validated, however for the developers a clear criterion would be that a drop down with the list of return reason stated in the organisation policy for customer to select plus the option of choosing "other" and typing the reason in a textbox if the customer reson is not listed. These types reason would them need to be manually validated(ofcourse you need to paraphrase it to act as Fit Criterion)
